I am building an amateur radio satellite tracking system.  It is both hardware
and software.  The core computing hardware is Raspberry Pi.  It is up and
running with go compiler and gobot package installed, tested and working.

I will write up my progress here as I go along.  My second step is work out
the orbital mechanics.  My starting point is this paper.

I am not sure of the applicable IP laws, so I will just like it here.

I have carried out his Adelaide calculations and I have included it in the
directory "background".
